Those files are the files for my Rick Roll USB Stick.

There are two version, the Lite version and the full version. If you install the Lite version you need to install nircmd and cmdmp3 by yourself. The full version will do this for you.

ATTENTION: Do it on a USB Stick or it will have serious consequences (You will probably not be able to unlock your Device again)!!! 

Lite Version (windowssysri_LITE.bat)
1) Create an directory with the Name "files" on an USB Stick.
2) Download the Lite Version file and put it in the "files" folder on the USB Stick.
3) Download nircmd from https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html or direct download: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.zip
4) Extract the files from the .zip file and place the nircmd.exe in the "files" folder on the USB Stick (You only need this file, you can delete the others).
5) Download cmdmp3 made by Jim Lawless from https://github.com/jimlawless/cmdmp3 or https://jiml.us/posts/cmdmp3/ or direct download https://jiml.us/downloads/cmdmp3.zip
6) Extract the files from the .zip file and place the cmdmp3.exe in the "files" folder on the USB Stick (You only need this file, you can delete the others).
7) Now you need to download a song (you can chose one, it doesn't matter), it must be an .mp3
8) Rename the song to "song.mp3" and put it in the "files" folder on the USB Stick.

Full Version (windowssysri.bat)
1) Create an directory with the Name "files" on an USB Stick.
2) Download the Full Version file and put it in the "files" folder on the USB Stick.
3) Now you need to download a song (you can chose one, it doesn't matter), it must be an .mp3
4) Rename the song to "song.mp3" and put it in the "files" folder on the USB Stick.

This project was made possible by Jim Lawless agreeing to the use of cmdmp3.
